**Does git care about file permissions?**

```
Git Tracks ONLY the Executable Bit of the Permissions for the User Who Owns the File. ... Other permissions (write and read) for the file's owner are not tracked. All permissions (execute, write and read) for other users in the file's group (g) and other users not in the files group (o) are not tracked.
```
