# Software Engineering

## What is software engineering?

>Software engineering is defined as the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.

### Definitions

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

**Software Engineers (SWE)**

#### Software Engineers categories

- **Junior engineer:** They have *recently started* their software development career and lacks the necessary experience to build and deploy production-grade software. Companies are usually keen on hiring junior engineers as it allows them to keep their hiring costs low. Companies often pair junior engineers with senior engineers to grow them into mid-level engineers and retain them for longer.

- **Mid-level engineer:** Someone who has at least three years of software development experience. They are expected to have a solid grasp of the various aspects of the software development life cycle and are the ones who can exert a significant impact on the amount of code that's produced. They ***not only*** *contribute code*, but also review and offer feedback.

- **Senior engineer:** This class of engineer is well-versed in a wide array of disparate technologies; their breadth of knowledge makes them ideal for ***assembling and managing software engineering teams***, as well as serving as ***mentors***. They have a deep understanding of a particular business domain. It allows them to serve as a liaison between team and the others *(technical and non-technical)*.

## Software Development Life Cycle



## Design

>DDD, or ***Domain-Driven Design***, is a software design approach that aims to create software that is focused on the core business domain, while also being flexible and adaptable to changes in that domain. The key idea behind DDD is that the domain should drive the design of the software, not the other way around.

### Domain and Entities

>Domain refers to a specific area of expertise or subject matter that a software system is designed to address. The domain is typically defined by a set of rules, concepts, and entities that are specific to that area.

>e.g. For example, the domain of a medical records system would be the healthcare industry. 
>The entities in this domain would include patients, medical professionals, medical facilities, medical procedures, and medical records. 

### ADDR

1. **Align:** Ensures alignment of understanding and scope across business, product,
and technology around a set of desired outcomes
2. **Define:** Maps business and customer requirements into digital capabilities that
will form the basis of one or more APIs to deliver the desired outcomes
3. **Design:** Applies specific design steps for each API to meet the desired outcomes
using one or more API styles
4. **Refine:** Refines the API design through feedback from developers, in addition
to documentation, prototyping, and testing efforts

## Job Stories

>Job stories were created by Alan Klement and are based on JTBD formulated by Christensen. They offer a simple framework to capture all of the aspects of the job
to be done. 
Teams producing job stories will find that their API designs focus more on the
desired outcomes of the audience. They will also have the details necessary to create acceptance criteria for automated tests. It is important to note that job stories shouldnâ€™t contain implementation specifics. Instead, they should elaborate on what
needs to happen to make the necessary progress to deliver the outcome.

>When I find a product I want to buy, I want to add the product to my shopping cart So I can include it in my order.
