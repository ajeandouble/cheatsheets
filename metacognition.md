### Books

*The Art of Learning* - Josh Waitzkin

## Fundamentals

>I had to figure out how to release myself from the baggage I
had acquired, and I developed a method of study that made chess and life begin
to merge in my being.

>I’d arrive at around four or five critical positions that *I didn’t quite understand*
or in which *I made an error*. Immediately after each of my games, I quickly
entered the moves into my computer, **noting my thought process** and how I
felt **emotionally** at various **stages** of the battle.

- Use a timeframe
- Describe your reasoning step by step
- Note everything that was not understood
	- This will feed the study plan
- Note when useless reasoning happens (e.g. reconsidering the same thing twice)
- Note when your mind wanders
- Separate intuition from proof
	- If something is proven no need to go back on it
	- If still the general proof can not been deduced, redo the reasoning
- Study negative feelings associated with over focusing on a task

>During my study of the critical positions, I noted the feeling I had
during the actual chess game. I explained above how in the pressure of
tournaments, the tension in the mind mounts with the tension in the position,
and an error on the board usually parallels a psychological collapse of sorts.

## Opposites

>In most everyday life experiences, there seems to be a tangible connection
between opposites. Consider how you may not realize how much someone’s
companionship means to you until they are gone—heartbreak can give the
greatest insight into the value of love. Think about how good a healthy leg
feels after an extended time on crutches—sickness is the most potent
ambassador for healthy living. Who knows water like a man dying of thirst?

## Be focused on the process (not just the result)

>A competitor needs to be process-oriented, always looking for stronger opponents to spur growth, but
it is also important to keep on winning enough to maintain confidence. We
have to release our current ideas to soak in new material, but not so much that
we lose touch with our unique natural talents. Vibrant, creative idealism needs
to be tempered by a practical, technical awareness.

&nbsp;
>Jack Kerouac’s vision was like electricity in my veins. His ability to draw sheer
joy from the most mundane experiences opened up the world to me. 

&nbsp;
>How can we incorporate these ideas into the real world? In certain
competitive arenas—our working lives, for example—there are seldom weeks
in which performance does not matter. Similarly, it is not so difficult to have a
beginner’s mind and to be willing to invest in loss when you are truly a
beginner, but it is much harder to maintain that humility and openness to
learning when people are watching and expecting you to perform. True
enough. This was a huge problem for me in my chess career after the movie
came out

## Resilience

>I mentioned that there are three critical steps in a resilient performer’s evolving
relationship to chaotic situations. First, we have to learn to be at peace with
imperfection. I mentioned the image of a blade of grass bending to hurricaneforce winds in contrast to a brittle twig snapping under pressure. Next, in our
performance training, we learn to use that imperfection to our advantage—for
example thinking to the beat of the music or using a shaking world as a
catalyst for insight. The third step of this process, as it pertains to performance
psychology, is to learn to create ripples in our consciousness, little jolts to spur
us along, so we are constantly inspired whether or not external conditions are
inspiring. If it initially took an earthquake or broken hand for me to gain
clarity, 

## Presence

> In a relaxed enough state of mind, you can zoom in on something in
front of you with great precision while maintaining a very sharp awareness of
your surroundings. Along these lines, chess players must let the unconscious
flow while the conscious leads and follows, sorting out details, putting things
in order, making precise mathematical calculations.
Most people would be surprised to discover that if you compare the thought
process of a Grandmaster to that of an expert (a much weaker, but quite
competent chess player), you will often find that the Grandmaster consciously
looks at less, not more. That said, the chunks of information that have been put
together in his mind allow him to see much more with much less conscious
thought. So he is looking at very little and seeing quite a lot. This is the
critical idea

&nbsp;
>In every discipline, the ability to be clearheaded, present, cool under fire is
much of what separates the best from the mediocre. In competition, the
dynamic is often painfully transparent. If one player is serenely present while
the other is being ripped apart by internal issues, the outcome is already clear.

### Meditation

- Body scan
- Feeling in your body

## Stress and recovery

>If you are interested in really improving as a performer, I would suggest
incorporating the rhythm of stress and recovery into all aspects of your life.
Truth be told, this is what my entire approach to learning is based on—
breaking down the artificial barriers between our diverse life experiences so all
moments become enriched by a sense of interconnectedness. So, if you are
reading a book and lose focus, put the book down, take some deep breaths, and
pick it up again with a fresh eye. If you are at work and find yourself running
out of mental stamina, take a break, wash your face, and come back renewed. It
would be an excellent idea to spend a few minutes a day doing some simple
meditation practice in which your mind gathers and releases with the ebb and
flow of your breath. This will help connect your physical interval training to
the mental arenas. If you enjoy the experience, gradually build up your mental
stamina and spend more time at it. When practiced properly, Tai Chi Chuan,
Yoga, or many forms of sitting meditation can be excellent vehicles for this
work.

## Incremental growth

>My response is that it is essential to have a liberating incremental approach
that allows for times when you are not in a peak performance state. We must
take responsibility for ourselves, and not expect the rest of the world to
understand what it takes to become the best that we can become. Great ones
are willing to get burned time and again as they sharpen their swords in the fire

&nbsp;
>To have success in crunch time, you need to integrate certain healthy patterns into your day-to-day life so that they are completely
natural to you when the pressure is on. The real power of incremental growth
comes to bear when we truly are like water, steadily carving stone. We just
keep on flowing when everything is on the line.

## Create the trigger

>This is a problem I have seen in many inconsistent performers. They are
frustrated and confused trying to find an inspiring catalyst for peak
performance, as if the perfect motivational tool is hovering in the cosmos
waiting for discovery. My method is to work backward and create the trigger.

### Trigger presence by setting up a routine

- Use a routine that makes you embrace a state of presence e.g:
	- Wake up
	- Meditate
	- Cold shower
	- Exercises
	- Breathing exercises
	- Stretching
	- Mindful eating

## Leveling up

>by zooming in on very small
details to which others are completely oblivious.
The beautiful thing about this approach to learning is that once we have felt
the profound refinement of a skill, no matter how small it may be, we can then
use that feeling as a beacon of quality as we expand our focus onto more and
more material. 

&nbsp;
While this principle of penetrating the macro through the micro is a critical
idea in the developmental process, it is also an absolutely pivotal foundation for
a great competitor. At the highest levels of any kind of competitive discipline,
everyone is great. At this point the decisive factor is rarely who knows more,
but who dictates the tone of the battle. For this reason, almost without
exception, champions are specialists whose styles emerge from profound
awareness of their unique strengths, and who are exceedingly skilled at guiding
the battle in that direction
