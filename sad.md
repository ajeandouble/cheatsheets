# Software Architecture and Design

## Domain Driven Design

>DDD, or Domain-Driven Design, is a software design approach that aims to create software that is focused on the core business domain, while also being flexible and adaptable to changes in that domain. The key idea behind DDD is that the domain should drive the design of the software, not the other way around.

### Domain and Entities

>Domain refers to a specific area of expertise or subject matter that a software system is designed to address. The domain is typically defined by a set of rules, concepts, and entities that are specific to that area.

>e.g. For example, the domain of a medical records system would be the healthcare industry. 
>The entities in this domain would include patients, medical professionals, medical facilities, medical procedures, and medical records. 

## ADDR

1. **Align:** Ensures alignment of understanding and scope across business, product,
and technology around a set of desired outcomes
2. **Define:** Maps business and customer requirements into digital capabilities that
will form the basis of one or more APIs to deliver the desired outcomes
3. **Design:** Applies specific design steps for each API to meet the desired outcomes
using one or more API styles
4. **Refine:** Refines the API design through feedback from developers, in addition
to documentation, prototyping, and testing efforts

## Job Stories

>Job stories were created by Alan Klement and are based on JTBD formulated by Christensen. They offer a simple framework to capture all of the aspects of the job
to be done. 
Teams producing job stories will find that their API designs focus more on the
desired outcomes of the audience. They will also have the details necessary to create acceptance criteria for automated tests. It is important to note that job stories shouldnâ€™t contain implementation specifics. Instead, they should elaborate on what
needs to happen to make the necessary progress to deliver the outcome.

>When I find a product I want to buy, I want to add the product to my shopping cart So I can include it in my order.
