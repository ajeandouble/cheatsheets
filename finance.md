### Private vs Public companies

>Public companies are companies whose ownership is organized via shares intended to be freely traded on a stock exchange or in over-the-counter markets.

>Because private companies do not need to appeal to shareholders, there is no need nor incentive to publish their financial statements. This is in contrast to public companies, which are required to make periodic financial statements available to the public.

### Assets, Equities, Liabilities, Capital

>Assets = Equities + Liabilities

>**Asset:** 

>**Equity:**

>**Liability:**

>**Cost Basis:**

### Financial statements and Financial Reporting

#### Difference Reporting and Statements

>**Financial reporting** is the process of providing information to company stakeholders to make decisions and the **financial statement** is the outcome of the process of financial reporting.

#### Financial Statements

>External financial reports are **accounts** – also known as **financial statements** – prepared by the managers of organisations to answer the legitimate questions of different stakeholders in the organisation’s activities. Stakeholders in companies include its owners (shareholders) who want to know, “What have you managers been doing with our money and our other assets?”  Other stakeholders include tax authorities, who want to know, “How much tax should the company be paying?”

>**External financial statements** are produced in standard formats, including **cash flow** statements, **balance sheets**, **income statements** and other information.  Internal financial reports will – ideally – include all the other information the managers need to run the business from day to day, as well as strategically.

>**Statement of changes in equity** is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances in a company's equity during a reporting period.

#### Financial Reporting

[SEC Fillings - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_filing)

The company announces a new business deal. Delisting notice. Shutting down a plant. Layoffs. Bankruptcy. These are all material events that would require an 8-K to be filed. The 8-K is extremely common, and many companies will file a number of 8-K's throughout the course of a quarter.`

>**10-Q:** Company's *quaterly report*. Generally less detailed that the Annual Report. Companies are required to file their 10-Q within 35 days of the end of their quarter. The issued Financial Statements are usually unaudited.

>**10-K:** Company's *annual report*. Extremely in depth document that contains everything you ever wanted about the company: executive compensation, audited financial statements, organization structure etc.

>**Bond:** Type of security under which the *issuer& (*debtor*) owes the holder (*creditor*) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called *the coupon*)

>**Corporate Bond:** Type of debt security that is issued by a firm and sold to investors. The company gets the capital it needs and in return the investor is paid a pre-established number of interest payments at either a fixed or variable interest rate.

### Reference Interest Rates

> **London Interbank Offered Rate** ***(LIBOR):*** A benchmark interest rate at which major global banks lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. It is based on five currencies including the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc. LIBOR is also the basis for consumer loans in countries around the world, so it impacts consumers just as much as it does financial institutions. The interest rates on various credit products such as credit cards, car loans, and adjustable-rate mortgages fluctuate based on the interbank rate.

> **The Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate** ***(SONIA):*** was established in 1997 by the Wholesale Markets Brokers' Association (WMBA) in Great Britain. Before the SONIA, the WMBA had no sterling overnight funding rate, which created volatility in the United Kingdom's overnight interest rates.

> The **IBOR transition** phase refers to the upcoming replacement of the reference rates (or benchmarks) by alternative **Risk Free Rates**. ***RFRs*** are "backward-looking" rates constructed on the basis of overnight deposits with banks. Traded on the very liquid money market, overnight loans, whether guaranteed or unsecured, present a very low counterparty risk compared to longer maturities.

### Loans

#### Credit Scores

>A **credit score** is a number from 300 to 850 that depicts a consumer’s creditworthiness. The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. *Equifax*, *Experian*, and *TransUnion*. This trio dominates the market for collecting, analyzing, and disbursing information about consumers in the credit markets.
