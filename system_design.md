## How to approach the question

### Requirements clarification

- Who will be using the system?
- How will they be using it?
- How many users are there?
- What does the system do?
- What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
- How much data is expected to be handled?
- How many requests per second are expected?
- What is the expected read-to-write ratio?

### Back-of-the-envelope estimation

- Read/Write ratio
- Number of concurrent requests
- Number of monthly request
- Number of daily active users
- etc.

### High-level design
